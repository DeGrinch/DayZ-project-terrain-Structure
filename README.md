# DayZ-project-terrain-Structure

Simple Dayz Terrain config templates.

This batch of folders & files structure are the same as can be found here... 
https://github.com/BohemiaInteractive/DayZ-Samples

However I have added some additional content within the folders in the shape of readme.txt files, some configuration changes, and I've also added some additional support in the form of links to community groups, as well as a possible video describing how to easily convert to a cleaner installation (as is defined in the above, and as is in comparrison to some people's processes in tutorials elsewhere on the internet).

My intention is not to take away from the project of the initial link, but instead to assist others in achieving a better understanding of the map development process, folder and file structuring, and simplify conversions of the files within the main repo in order to make the process of community involvement and development a bit less complicated.

Overall the purpose here is to take a deeper look at particular aspects of the map (test-terrain) folder, its configuration files and/or any additional possibilties for the modding community which may not be addressed in official documents or repos for one reason or another.
