# DayZ-project-terrain-Structure

Simple Dayz Terrain config templates.

This batch fo folders and files structure are the same as they can be found here... https://github.com/BohemiaInteractive/DayZ-Samples
However I have added some additional content within the folders in readme files, and I've also added some additional support links and possible a video or two
in order to assist with better understanding the process, the structures, and the files within, including some what of a deeper look at particular aspects of it all.
