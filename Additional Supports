Our website offers many developer tools which you will not find elsewhere online (to the best of my knowledge) and I have searched for a long time before
I decided to just start putting my own tools together...   We are still porting everything over to our new website design, so some tools are still in the process of conversion to this new area.
Long story short, we have tools that will check most of your config files for errors you would normally spend a huge amount of time trying to 
find yourself. Double entries, double variable tags or etc. Log file review and simplification. etc etc...

For a more specific growing list of tools please visit this link.
