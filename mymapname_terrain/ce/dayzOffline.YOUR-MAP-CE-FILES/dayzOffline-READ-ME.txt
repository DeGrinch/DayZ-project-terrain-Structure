This folder, once you rename it, can be used to store any specific map/server configuration files that are
specific to your map or server needs. 

The content that would be placed in here is that of the same content you would place within mpmissions/dayzOffline.mapname 
folder, and it would apply default server configurations. Please note, additional changes that are made to the server's 
actual mpmissions/dayzOffline.mapname should over-rule any configurations within this directory, at run time.

I could be wrong about this at present I've not tested a fully packed ce.pbo just yet to see if adding a 
env/zombies_territories.xml file in the mpmissions will over rule my ce.pbo packed env/zombies_territories.xml configuration
or etc

I'll update this further once I have time to play around with these things.
